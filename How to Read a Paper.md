##  This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers

reasons: to re- view them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new field.

### The first pass

gives you a general idea about the paper
The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper

-  take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:

	- 1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
	- 2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
	- 3. Read the conclusions
	- 4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read

-  five Cs:

	- 1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measure- ment paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
	- 2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
	- 3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
	- 4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contribu- tions?
	- 5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

- Using this information, you may choose not to read fur- ther. This could be because the paper doesn’t interest you, or you don’t know enough about the area to understand the paper, or that the authors make invalid assumptions.

	- If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

### The Second Pass

grasp the paper’s content, but not its details
read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs.

- 1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illus- trations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.



	- Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically sig- nificant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

- 2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for fur- ther reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).
- The second pass should take up to an hour. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper.



	- You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the pa- per, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality.
	- Sometimes you won’t understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. This may be because the subject matter is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms.


	- Or the authors may use a proof or experimental technique that you don’t understand, so that the bulk of the pa- per is incomprehensible. 

		-  You can now choose to: 

			- (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be successful in your career, 
			- (b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material 
			- (c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

### The Third Pass

helps you understand the paper in depth.
The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work.

- This pass requires great attention to detail. 

	-  You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
	-  you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea
	-  During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

- This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader.
-  At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.
-  In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

## Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey.

### First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent papers in the area.

-  Do one pass on each pa- per to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.
-  You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper.
- If you can find such a survey, you are done.

### Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. 

-  Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently.
- That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top con- ferences.

### The third step is to go to the website for these top con- ferences and look through their recent proceedings

- These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, con- stitute the first version of your survey.
-  Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as neces- sary.

### If you are reading a paper to do a review, you should also read Timothy Roscoe’s paper on “Writing reviews for sys- tems conferences” [2]. If you’re planning to write a technical paper, you should refer both to Henning Schulzrinne’s com- prehensive web site [3] and George Whitesides’s excellent overview of the process [4]. Finally, Simon Peyton Jones has a website that covers the entire spectrum of research skills [1].
